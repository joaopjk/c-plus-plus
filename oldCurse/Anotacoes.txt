Declaring and initializing Variables
Naming Variables:
- Can contain letters, number, and underscores
- Must begin with a letter or underscore
  - can't begin with a number
- Can't use C++ reserved keywords
- Can't redeclare a name in the same scope
  - remember, that c++ is case sensitive

int age;
